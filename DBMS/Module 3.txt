Q1. What does the CREATE DATABASE command do?
A) Creates tables – ❌ Incorrect. This command creates databases, not tables.
B) Creates a new database – ✅ Correct. The CREATE DATABASE command is used to create a new database.
C) Creates a column – ❌ Incorrect. Columns are created using CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE.
D) None of the above – ❌ Incorrect. Option B is correct.

Q2. What is the correct syntax to create a database named company?
A) MAKE DATABASE company; – ❌ Incorrect. MAKE is not a valid SQL keyword.
B) CREATE DB company; – ❌ Incorrect. While some systems may understand this, standard SQL uses CREATE DATABASE.

D) BUILD DATABASE company; – ❌ Incorrect. BUILD is not a valid SQL keyword for this purpose.

Q3. Which clause prevents error if the database already exists?

A) Deletes only structure – ❌ Incorrect. Structure remains intact; only data is deleted.
B) Deletes all rows quickly – ✅ Correct. TRUNCATE TABLE removes all rows efficiently.
C) Renames the table – ❌ Incorrect. Use RENAME TABLE or ALTER for that.
D) Creates a new table – ❌ Incorrect. Use CREATE TABLE for that.

Q42. Which is faster: DELETE or TRUNCATE?
A) DELETE – ❌ Incorrect. DELETE is slower, especially for large datasets.
B) TRUNCATE – ✅ Correct. TRUNCATE is faster as it bypasses row-by-row deletion and logging.

Q43. What happens to auto-increment value after TRUNCATE?
A) Continues from last – ❌ Incorrect. That’s for DELETE.
B) Resets to initial – ✅ Correct. TRUNCATE resets the auto-increment counter.
C) Doubles – ❌ Nonsensical.
D) Sets to zero – ❌ Incorrect. It resets to initial, not necessarily zero (could be 1).

Q44. Can TRUNCATE be rolled back?
A) Yes – ❌ Incorrect in most databases (unless inside a transaction in some RDBMS).
B) No – ✅ Correct. TRUNCATE is generally DDL and cannot be rolled back once committed.

Q45. Can TRUNCATE be used if a table has a foreign key constraint?
A) Yes – ❌ Incorrect. Most RDBMS restrict TRUNCATE on tables with FK constraints.
B) No – ✅ Correct. You usually need to disable the FK or use DELETE instead.

Q46. What SQL category is TRUNCATE?

Q49. What happens to table structure after TRUNCATE?
A) Removed – ❌ Incorrect. Structure remains.
B) Renamed – ❌ Incorrect. Table name is unaffected.
C) Retained – ✅ Correct. Only data is deleted; schema remains.
D) Changed – ❌ Incorrect. No structural change occurs.

Q50. TRUNCATE affects how many rows?
A) Only 1 – ❌ Incorrect.
B) Only NULL rows – ❌ Incorrect.
C) All rows – ✅ Correct. TRUNCATE removes all rows from the table.
