B) Simple – ❌ Incorrect. Simple attributes can't be broken down further.
C) Derived – ❌ Incorrect. Derived attributes are computed from other values.
D) Multi-valued – ❌ Incorrect. These store multiple values, not sub-parts.

A) One-to-One – ❌ Incorrect. That would imply one employee to one department and vice versa.
B) Many-to-One – ❌ Incorrect. Implies many departments per employee, which is not correct.
C) One-to-Many – ✅ Correct. One department can have many employees, but each employee belongs to one department.
D) Many-to-Many – ❌ Incorrect. Not applicable here as it suggests multiple departments per employee.

Q39. A ternary relationship involves:
A) One entity set – ❌ Incorrect. That’s unary.
B) Two entity sets – ❌ Incorrect. That’s binary.
C) Three entity sets – ✅ Correct. Ternary relationships involve three different entity sets.

A) Binary relationship – ❌ Incorrect. Two entities only; this involves three.
B) Unary relationship – ❌ Incorrect. Unary is self-relationship within one entity.
C) Ternary relationship – ✅ Correct. Since three entities are involved (student, course, instructor), a ternary relationship is best.
D) Weak relationship – ❌ Incorrect. There is no dependency here indicating a weak entity.

A) True – ✅ Correct. A composite attribute can contain multiple components, and each component may be multi-valued.
B) False – ❌ Incorrect.

Q48. One-to-one relationships are rare in practice.
